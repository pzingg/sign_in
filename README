Ldap-backed sign-in using Rails 2.3.  Includes functionality to store and
deliver user-associated PDF report cards in SQL.

Adapted from thoughtbot's "clearance" plugin:

SQL user database that is authenticated and updated against an ldap server.
Lookup is by email address.  Email addresses can be associated with 
mulitple ldap entries in different organizational units.  Passwords
are checked against all of an email address's entries, and authentication
passes if any of them match.

Next feature: Permit users to change passwords in the ldap database; 
password changes must be confirmed by email address (or not).

Then: Use Rails Metal to use the authentication for password protecting
a static website.

Possibly: Use a reverse proxy front-end to detect and distribute 
authentication cookies among different domains (PowerSchool, Schoolwires,
and KSD's internal servers).
